= CSC8110 Cloud Computing Coursework

== Outline
In this coursework we will consider the scenario of a network of "Smart Speed Cameras", equipped with Automatic Number Plate Recognition software. Newcastle City Council wish to scale the processing of this speed camera data into the Cloud. This coursework provides you with the opportunity to develop an entire Cloud-based system, connected using Azure's Service Bus brokering system. As a result you will need to become familiar with a wide range of technologies. It is important that you start the work early and ask for help when needed. By completing this coursework, you will gain some useful experience and skills.

=== Aims
* To make appropriate use of a variety of technologies to build a traffic management application in the Microsoft Azure cloud.
* To gain familiarity, and reflect on, the use of Cloud technologies to tackle a real-world problem.

=== Objectives
* Programming, problem solving and system-design skills.
* To gain experience using Microsoft Azure and the Azure SDK.
* To gain practical experience using a message brokering system in the Cloud.
* To gain experience using Azure Table Storage data stores in the Cloud.
